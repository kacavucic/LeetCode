    Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take different forms during runtime. To be more specific it's the
    execution of the override method that is related to a specific object type at runtime.

    In Java, we can achieve polymorphism using interfaces. For example, the Shape interface can take different
    forms â€” it can be a Circle or a Square.
